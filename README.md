CS 290 - Final Project:

Moody Sites

This is a website that you can visit no matter what mood you're in - 

Feeling bored? Get suggestions for some interesting websites, articles and so on.

Feeling hungry? Look at some appetizing pictures and recipes.

Feeling funny? There's some good memes, Facebook pages and Subreddits to make you laugh.

Feeling lonely? Come look at cute cats, take a quiz, find out some fun stuff about yourself.

Go ahead and type in another mood and we'll match up similar moods so you can feel that way.

If you're on an existing page and you want to add your own option for that mood, feel free to click on the button on the bottom right and add your information there!

Make sure you put in something in all of the boxes or else you will get an error!
